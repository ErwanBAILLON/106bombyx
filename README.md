# 106bombyx

{EPITECH} | First year | Math project

In the 70’s, chaos theory opened the way for a better understanding of the evolution of some animal
species. Butterflys for instance. Let’s look at... bombyx.

If a generation is crowded, chances are that the next generation will be crowded too, regarding the natu-
ral rules of reproduction. But resources may lack for this new generation, so it may not be able to develop.
Therefore, the number of bombyx depends on those two contradictory factors, and its evolution is far from
trivial.
